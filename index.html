                    <p class="about-lede">For over a decade, I've had the incredible privilege of documenting love stories across the Pacific Northwest. Based in Seattle, I specialize in documentary-style wedding photography with editorial polish—capturing authentic moments as they unfold while guiding you when you need it.</p>
                    <p class="about-lede">My approach is simple: I believe your wedding day should feel like YOUR day, not a photoshoot. I blend into the background to capture genuine emotions, candid laughter, and those fleeting moments you might otherwise miss. When it's time for portraits, I provide gentle direction to create timeless, artful images that feel natural and authentic.</p>

                    <p>I fell in love with photography <em>[share your origin story—first camera, darkroom, or moment you knew]</em>. What drew me to weddings specifically was <em>[describe the emotion, storytelling, or energy that hooked you]</em>. There's something magical about being trusted to document one of the most important days in a couple's life.</p>
                    <p>Over the past 10+ years, I've photographed over <em>[number]</em> weddings across Seattle, the Eastside, and throughout the Pacific Northwest. From intimate elopements on ferries to grand celebrations at iconic Seattle venues, each wedding tells a unique story.</p>

                    <h3>At Home in the Pacific Northwest</h3>
                    <p>Living and working in Seattle means I know this region intimately. From the dramatic waterfront at Golden Gardens to the urban elegance of downtown venues, from the lush forests of the Eastside to the stunning mountain backdrops—I know where to find the best light, the hidden photo spots, and how to make the most of every location.</p>
                    <p>I also know Seattle weather. Rain doesn't phase me—I bring clear umbrellas, embrace the moody atmosphere, and always have backup plans. Some of my favorite images have been captured on misty, romantic Seattle days.</p>
