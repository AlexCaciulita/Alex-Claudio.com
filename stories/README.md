Stories structure

- stories/index.html — landing page listing all stories
- stories/weddings/{slug}/index.html — individual story pages
- stories/weddings/{slug}/images/ — photos for that wedding (cover + gallery)

Conventions

- Slugs: lowercase, hyphen-separated (e.g., samantha-and-jake, sarah-michael-volunteer-park).
- Images: include a cover (cover.jpg) for the card and numbered images (01.jpg, 02.jpg…) for the gallery.
- Links: story cards on stories/index.html should link to weddings/{slug}/.
